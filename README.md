# BitcoinPrice-Tracker
This is a script written in python , which notifies you when ever the price of bitcoin drops a certain value.

It takes a user defined value and then monitors the current value of bitcoin in real time.
If the value of bitcoin drops the value defined by you , it gives  you a notification on your desktop and also sends you an email alerting you about the price drop.

You can set your email id in the code and the credentials for that in env variables.
